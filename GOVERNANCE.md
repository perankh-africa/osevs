# Governance (Draft)

OSEVS is intended to be a Digital Public Good.

## Stewardship
- Maintained initially by PerAnkh contributors
- Guided by feedback from institutions, implementers, and the community

## Decision-making
- Changes proposed via Issues/PRs
- Schema changes require review and versioning
- Breaking changes only introduced via major version bump

## Values
- Interoperability over lock-in
- Evidence-based representation
- Privacy-by-design
- Inclusion of informal/vocational learning realities
