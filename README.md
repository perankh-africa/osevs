# OSEVS — Open Skills Evidence & Verification Schema

OSEVS is an open, interoperable schema for representing **demonstrated skills** and the **evidence + verification** that makes those skills legible and trusted—especially in informal and vocational learning contexts.

OSEVS is designed as **digital public infrastructure**, not a platform.

## Why OSEVS?
In many contexts, young people gain real skills through apprenticeships, vocational training, informal work, and self-directed learning. Yet these skills remain hard to verify, compare, or trust using traditional credentials.

OSEVS provides a standard way to represent:
- **Skills** (as demonstrated capability)
- **Evidence** (artifacts, demonstrations, assessments)
- **Verification** (who validated, how, under what context)
- **Confidence metadata** (strength, recency, role, method)

## What OSEVS is (and isn't)
✅ A standard data model for skills evidence + verification  
✅ Interoperable and vendor-neutral  
✅ Designed for low-resource environments

❌ Not a badge system  
❌ Not a certificate format  
❌ Not an LMS or marketplace  
❌ Not a replacement for credentials

## Status
This repository is an **initial public draft**. The schema and documentation will evolve via pilots and community feedback.
